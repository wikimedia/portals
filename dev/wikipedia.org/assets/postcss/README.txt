Post CSS Guide
==============
The files in the directory are processed by postCSS.

Files that begin with an underscore
-----------------------------------
These files are treated as 'partials'.They should be
included in 'main' files using @import statements.
PostCSS-import will expand the @import statements
and merge these files into the main file.

Files that don't begin with an underscore
-----------------------------------------
These are the 'Main' files. They are process by PostCSS
and output into the css folder. These files can then
be referenced in the HTML file with <link rel='stylesheet> tags.

Special files
-------------
_vars.css - is reserved for css variables (css custom properties).
_ie.css - reserved for IE6 and IE7 specific styles.
